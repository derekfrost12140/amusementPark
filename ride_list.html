            <h2>Aquaman</h2>
            <p>Experience the powerful force of this aquatic attraction as you’re pulled back and forth, mimicking the mighty waves of the ocean. Plunge into the thrill of the ride, feeling the rush of the water and the exhilaration of the sea’s might, until finally splashing down in a tidal wave of excitement and adrenaline-pumping wah-hoooooos.
                Twin 150’ towers rock this coaster to and fro, with multiple 90° drops that plunge passengers through the water at a rapid 63 mph, embodying the power and agility of the superhero!
                If your group is looking for a way to cool down, no other super hero beats the villainous summer heat quite like the Aquaman roller coaster. Grab some cold beverages and treats nearby, then climb aboard and let Aquaman do the rest!</p>

            <h2>Batman</h2>
            <p>See what it’s like behind the mask on this deeply intense, 50-mph juggernaut as you star in your own GOTHAM adventure in this thrilling BATMAN roller coaster.
                Climb aboard the BATMOBILE and prepare to sweep through the city suspended from an overhead track, your feet dangling in the air. With five inversions and enough G-force to plaster you to your seat, this ride is not for the timid.
                Following a 10-story lift to the top of the world, brace yourself for a full 360-degree loop right from the start. Then, brace yourself for a fully inverted roll and a second loop about ten seconds later.
                Next, you’ll be propelled into pure adrenaline by a double set of wingover loops and corkscrew descents. Watch the city below as you’re swept away just like the criminals of GOTHAM CITY.
                Defy gravity as you quadruple it. As you soar above the park, you’ll briefly experience 4 G-force, pressing you to your seat with four-times the amount of typical gravity; all while taking on the ultimate gravity-defying twists and turns. </p>

            <h2>El Diablo</h2>
            <p>Don’t worry—you don’t have to sell your soul to ride this devil of a coaster; however, you might feel it leave your body a few times. This deceptively simple-looking ride throws its passengers around for six full 180s, at a breathtaking 6.66 seconds per loop. Climb in, if you dare, and experience the heart-pounding sensation of the biggest loops at the park.
                This 100 foot super loop spins riders around and around for six full inversions, offering the ultimate adrenaline rush for thrill-seekers.
                Ever wonder what someone’s face looks like in a state of perpetual thrills? El Diablo has face-to-face seating, so there’s no need to wonder any longer. </p>

            <h2>Roller Coaster</h2>
            <p>Step into the chilling lair of MR. FREEZE, BATMAN’S cold-blooded arch nemesis. This evil guy’s home decor might look a bit fridged, but the acceleration of his coaster is absolutely scorching. Using cutting-edge electromagnetic technology, this mad man launches his victims from a chilling tunnel, sending them flying from 0-70 miles per hour in a mind-melting 3.8 seconds!
                As soon as you exit the tunnel, you’re sent flying up a staggeringly high “top hat” loop. As you hurtle up and then back down this loop at 90 degrees, your train spins around sideways like the corkscrewing blades of a giant slushy machine. And that’s only the beginning.
                Just when you think you’ve had all the twists and turns you can take, you’re rocketed up a 236-foot tall tower to do it all over again… in reverse!</p>
